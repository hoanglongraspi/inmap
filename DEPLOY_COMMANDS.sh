git commit -m "fix(map): resolve cluster rendering issue on Vercel

- Fix map initialization timing to prevent race conditions
- Map now initializes immediately without waiting for data
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging in production
- Add defensive checks in refreshSafe() function
- Fix ESLint warning for useEffect dependencies

Technical changes:
- Remove sites.length check from map init useEffect
- Change dependency array to empty [] for single init
- Add detailed console logs at each initialization step
- Add error logging when sources not found
- Better warning messages for debug

This resolves the issue where maps display correctly on local
but clusters don't appear on Vercel production deployment.
